            "At this time last year, I was stuck in a dead end job, was questioning my career, and felt like I wasn't living up to my potential. This year, I have a job at a place that is genuinely excited to help me learn and grow. I'm really passionate about development and couldn't be more excited to keep learning in this field."

            "The internship I did with Epicodus was an awesome experience and invaluable in my job search. After completing Epicodus, I sent out quite a few resumes, and ultimately had the choice between two very interested companies. I've worked just over a month now at my new job and couldn't be happier."
